Lead Javascript - Traci Williams

### About: 

This was our first group project at General Assembly. This was the second week of class after we fully immersed in HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT/JQUERY.

Traci and myself have a passion for Education from teaching to policy reform. We wanted to create a game in the short 24 hours we were given.

Practice your third grade math skills with our simple multiplication game.

### Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- JavaScript

### Approach: 

1) Game idea sketches, extremely simple wireframes.
2) Collaborate on the HTML structure.
3) Divide HTML/CSS (Christopher) and Javascript (Traci).
4) Merge and Test Code.
5) Deploy on Github/Heroku when completed.

### Update:

The game has been updated from Javascript to jQuery. 
Less code and easy on the eyes.

This game made me realize that I still count on my fingers.
